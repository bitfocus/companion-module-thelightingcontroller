## The Lighting Controller

Should work with all releases of The Lighting Controller - http://thelightingcontroller.com, which is more commonly know as -
- Showtec QuickDMX

Control is achieved over TCP using the [Published Protocol](http://download.thelightingcontroller.com/software/External_Application/Protocol.pdf).

**Available commands for Blackmagic Design ATEM**

- Set BPM
- Toggle a button (Equivalent to LiveMobile)
- Press a button (Useful when using Solo Buttons as prevents accident unsetting)
- Release a button (For completeness)
- Custom Command (Advanced users only - allows sending a custom TCP command for future-proofing)
